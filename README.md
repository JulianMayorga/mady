# Mady [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/mady.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mady)

An easy-to-use tool to manage and translate ICU MessageFormat messages.

![Mady UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guigrpa/mady/master/docs/01-ui.png)

*Yes, it's Mady's view of herself!* :open_mouth: For more details on the MessageFormat syntax (*hamburger* examples above), [see the MessageFormat guide](https://messageformat.github.io/guide/):

```js
console.log(_t("someContext_{NUM, plural, one{1 hamburger} other{# hamburgers}}", { NUM: 1 }));
// 1 hamburguesa
console.log(_t("someContext_{NUM, plural, one{1 hamburger} other{# hamburgers}}", { NUM: 2 }));
// 2 hamburguesas
```

Remember: this is not only for translation! Even if you only use English, you may need MessageFormat for gender and pluralization.

## Why?

* **MessageFormat messages**: while it does not solve all the problems in the huge field of i18n, MessageFormat is a much more powerful tool than the conventional gettext (IMHO).
* **Full UNICODE support**: messages and translations can include any UNICODE character. In other words, you can now translate üëç (en) as üëè (es-ES) and then üíÉ (es-ES-andalusia)!
* Use it as a development tool in your project: an **easy-to-use UI** that allows **parsing source files, adding languages and translations, comparing translations side-by-side, and compiling to (optionally minified) JavaScript modules**.
* Use it as a library: a no-frills translate function to run the compiled language modules.

## Installation

```
$ npm install --save mady
```


## Usage

There are two main parts in Mady: the web-based translation app and the translate function.


### The translation app

Access the translation app by running:

```bash
$ ./node_modules/.bin/mady
```

Or just add the following line to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
    "translate": "mady"
}
```

and run `npm run translate`.

The first time you run it, Mady will ask you for some additional information: the path to your locales folder and a default port for the application. Now open Mady's URL in your browser (http://localhost:8080 by default) and there you go!

From the web application, you can:

* Update the key database with new keys extracted from your source files
* Configure your languages, source paths, file extensions, etc.
* Translate your keys to the different supported languages
* [Automatically] export translations to JS files, for use by the [translate function](#the-translate-function)

Messages in your source files should have the form: `_t('someContext_Once upon a time...')` (single or double quotes are supported), where `_t()` is the default name for the translate function (see below), `someContext` is some hint for the translator and `Once upon a time...` is your untranslated [MessageFormat](#messageformat) message.

Configuration looks like this:

![Mady config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guigrpa/mady/master/docs/02-config.png)

You can see the UI in English, Spanish and Catalan at the moment. Mady *eats her own dog food*.


### The translate function

Using the translate function is similarly straightforward:

```js
import _t from 'mady';
import locales from './locales/es';

_t.setLocales(locales);

console.log(_t('someContext_Once upon a time...'));
// √ârase una vez...
console.log(_t('someContext_Number of items: {NUM}', { NUM: 5 }));
// N√∫mero de √≠tems: 5
console.log(_t("someContext_{NUM, plural, one{1 hamburger} other{# hamburgers} }", { NUM: 1 }));
// 1 hamburguesa
console.log(_t("someContext_{NUM, plural, one{1 hamburger} other{# hamburgers} }", { NUM: 2 }));
// 2 hamburguesas
```


## MessageFormat

Mady uses the [messageformat.js](https://github.com/SlexAxton/messageformat.js) library by Alex Sexton, which "supports and extends all parts of the **ICU MessageFormat** standard (see the [user guide](http://userguide.icu-project.org/formatparse/messages)), with the exception of the deprecated ChoiceFormat." IMHO, and while it does not solve all the problems in the huge field of i18n, it is a much more powerful tool than the conventional gettext.

Some examples of MessageFormat messages are given above ([more here](https://messageformat.github.io/guide/)), but this does not even scratch the surface of what is enabled by this standard.


## Internals

Mady is built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/).

## Why *Mady*?

This library is named after my cousin, a brilliant person with an extraordinary talent for languages. I thank her for teaching me English when I was a little child.
